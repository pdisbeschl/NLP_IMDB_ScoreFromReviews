# NLP_IMDB_ScoreFromReviews
NLP Project: Predicting ratings associated with reviews on IMDB through supervised learning

The program itself can be found in the [Jupyter notebook in our repository](https://github.com/pdisbeschl/NLP_IMDB_ScoreFromReviews/blob/master/classifiersFINAL.ipynb)

The dataset used can be found [here](https://mega.nz/#F!8aRBDYYa!-P3lEjN0jOJgGRTaq91yOg) , it is a slightly modified version of the [SAR14 dataset of Dai Quoc Nguyen et al.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14ZXV_RWdBgyLYECd7XJnxf2G2fCEfQkp). Our dataset differs from the original in that each mention of "ca n't" has been replaced by "can't", this is assumed to be a parsing error in the original. The original paper for which this dataset was created can be found [here](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-2621)
